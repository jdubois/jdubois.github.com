                I am a frequent speaker at conferences (Devoxx, Spring One, etc) and user groups around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                My main topics are on Java, JHipster, Spring, Azure and AI: most of my talks are live-coding sessions or workshops, where I show how to build applications using the Open Source projects I contribute to.
            </p>

            <h2>Current talks</h2>

            <p>
                Here is a list of my current talks: <a href="/current-talks">current talks by Julien Dubois</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you would like me to talk at one of your events, please <a href="/contact">contact me</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>Videos</h2>

            <p>
                Here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCJhCeRfMgNJtjA9ROXKwR-6QtkYCeXK5" target="_blank">a list of YouTube videos</a> with my talks, that I try to update frequently.
            </p>

            <h2>Workshops</h2>

            <p>
                Most of my work is done through workshops, so if you attended one and are looking for the code, it's very probably available on <a href="https://github.com/jdubois" target="_blank">my GitHub page</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>Presentations</h2>

            <p>Most of my talks are live-coding sessions, but when I do presentations they are uploaded on <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/julien.dubois/presentations" target="_blank">my Slideshare account</a>.</p>

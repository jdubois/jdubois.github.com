    <h1>JHipster</h1>

    <p>I created JHipster in 2013 to solve a common problem: how to quickly generate modern, production-ready web applications with best practices built in from day one.</p>

    <h2>What is JHipster?</h2>
    <p>
      JHipster is a development platform that generates complete Spring Boot + Angular/React/Vue.js applications with a professional-grade architecture. It includes authentication, database integration, monitoring, Docker support, and deployment configurations—everything you need to build enterprise-quality applications.
    </p>

    <h2>Impact &amp; Community</h2>
    <p>
      Today, JHipster has grown into one of the most popular Open Source development platforms:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>22,000+ stars on GitHub</li>
        <li>Used by thousands of companies worldwide, from startups to Fortune 500 enterprises</li>
        <li>Active community of 800+ contributors</li>
        <li>Millions of generated applications</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      While I stepped back from day-to-day leadership to focus on other projects like <a href="/langchain4j">LangChain4j</a>, I remain involved as the project founder and president of the <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/association/" target="_blank">JHipster Developers Association</a>.

    <h2>AI for the Spring Ecosystem</h2>
    <p>
      I contribute to <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-ai" target="_blank">Spring AI</a>, the official AI framework for Spring developers. Spring AI provides a Spring-friendly abstraction layer for building AI applications, integrating seamlessly with the Spring Boot ecosystem that millions of developers already know and trust.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Spring AI Matters</h2>
    <p>
      For developers already working with Spring Boot, Spring AI offers a natural way to add AI capabilities to their applications. It follows familiar Spring patterns like dependency injection, auto-configuration, and starter modules, making it easy to integrate AI features without learning entirely new paradigms.

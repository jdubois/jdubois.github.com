<h2>Speaking</h2>

I am a frequent speaker at conferences (Devoxx, Spring One, etc) and user groups around the world.
My main topics are on Java, JHipster, Spring, Azure and AI: most of my talks are live-coding sessions or workshops, where I show how to build applications using the Open Source projects I contribute to.

Here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCJhCeRfMgNJtjA9ROXKwR-6QtkYCeXK5" target="_blank">a list of YouTube videos</a> that I try to update frequently.

If you would like me to talk at one of your event, please <a href="/contact.html">contact me</a>.

<h2>Presentations</h2>

<p>Most of my talks are live-coding sessions, but when I do presentations you can find them on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/julien.dubois/presentations" target="_blank">my Slideshare account</a>.</p>

    <h2>Bringing AI to Java Developers</h2>
    <p>
      I'm one of the core contributors to <a href="https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j" target="_blank">LangChain4j</a>, the leading AI framework for Java developers. LangChain4j makes it easy to build AI-powered applications using Large Language Models (LLMs), with a clean, idiomatic Java API.
    </p>

    <h2>Why LangChain4j Matters</h2>
    <p>
      While Python dominates the AI landscape, millions of enterprise applications are built with Java. LangChain4j bridges this gap, allowing Java developers to integrate cutting-edge AI capabilities into their existing applications without switching languages or frameworks.
    </p>

    <h2>My Contributions</h2>
    <p>
      As part of my work at Microsoft, I focus on:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Microsoft Foundry integration and optimization</li>
        <li>The OpenAI Java SDK module</li>
        <li>Structured Outputs and Function Calling implementations</li>
        <li>Documentation, tutorials, and developer advocacy</li>
        <li>Enterprise patterns and best practices</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I regularly speak about LangChain4j at conferences and create content to help Java developers get started with AI. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> to learn more and start building AI-powered Java applications.

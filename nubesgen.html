    <p>
      <strong>NubesGen was an Open Source project I created as part of my daily job as a developer advocate at Microsoft, and it is no longer maintained</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      NubesGen was a Web application that generated an "Infrastructure as Code" configuration easily, giving you all the best practices to deploy your code to Azure,
      without the hassle. You can find full information on the project on <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/NubesGen" target="_blank">the NubesGen GitHub repository</a>.
